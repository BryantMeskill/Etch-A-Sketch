This project was made with inspiration from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) to further enhance my HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills.

## Here are a few of the skills I honed in on this project: ##
* DOM manipulation and element creation via JavaScript
* Writing cleaner, easier to read JavaScript. 
* Debugging and problem solving in Google Chrome, locating issues related to DOM created elements.
* Researching solutions to problems I've not yet solved in older projects.

In the future, I'd like to revisit this project and add further functionality to the project via a 'rainbow mode', which changes the UI element
colors as well as allowing you to draw randomly-colored tiles on mouseover. This was partially implemented, which can be seen if you view my JavaScript
code. I have shelved this implemenation to move onto other projects.
